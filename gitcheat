git cheatsheet
-------------
git show (or git diff HEAD^ HEAD)                   - Compare current commit to previous (HEAD^ is previous commit)
git diff					    - Show unstaged changes made since last commit
git diff --cached				    - Show changes staged for commit
git diff HEAD					    - Show changes staged and unstaged since last commit
git diff origin/master master			    - Compare Github to local branch commit (assumes local is working copy)

Branches
git branch -r					    - List local and remote branches
git branch new-branch				    - Create branch named new-branch based on current
git checkout new-branch				    - Switch to branch named new-branch
git checkout -b new-branch			    - Create new branch based on current and switch to it
git branch -D old-branch			    - Force delete the local branch called old-branch

Resetting
git reset --hard				    - Throw away all local changes since last commit, reset index and HEAD
git reset HEAD~	 				    - Undo last commit, leave working tree as is.
git reset filename				    - Remove a file from staging area (no filename removes all)
